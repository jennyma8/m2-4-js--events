# The Events Workshop

## Exercise 2 - The Final Countdown... Clock... and Timer.

_Remember that optional exercise from the last workshop..._

Now that you know events, you can make it much better for the user.

**Note:** If you skipped the challenge question yesterday, take a quick look at it, but you don't have to complete it to do this one. I fully expect everyone to start from scratch!

### The Task

Create a page that

1. contains 3 sections (one for each of the following)
2. displays the current time
3. contains a start/stop button with a stopwatch which starts at 00:00 and continues until the user clicks "stop"
4. contains a timer where the user can enter a number of seconds, click start and the timer counts down to 0. ///stretch: There should be a sound announcing the end as well.

### Make it look "decent"

Be as creative as you like. It doesn't need to be complicated, just a little "purty."
